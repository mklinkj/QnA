hello.

In the example code, there is a problem where the auto-increment value cannot be retrieved after INSERT and is returned as null.

* https://github.com/Apress/spring-5-recipes/blob/5fc7cc9f3e97b2486541caa1ae8bf5a95c03152b/spring-recipes-4th/appendix-b/recipe_b_6_i/src/main/java/com/apress/springrecipes/caching/JdbcCustomerRepository.java#L46-L54

So, I added Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS as the second parameter when running prepareStatement().

I also corrected what appeared to be simple typos.

  * Remove unnecessary commas at the end of column properties.

  * Remove semicolon at the end of SQL statement.

thank you have a good day. üëç
